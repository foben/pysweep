# PySweep 1.0
Welcome to PySweep, a command line Minesweeper clone written in Python.

To start, run the script with three additional parameters,
specifying the height and width of the game board 
and the number of mines placed:

    python pysweep.py 10 10 5


In the game, you can clear a field and see how many surrounding mines there are
(You should be sure the field itself does not contain one ;) ), flag and unflag
fields or test your solution:

    type "y, x" to clear a field 
    type "y, x," (trailing comma) to flag a field as mined
    flag same field again to remove flag
    type "solve" to check your solution

Have fun ;)
